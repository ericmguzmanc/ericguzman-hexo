## **The Foundation**

It's easy to make a decision, the dificult part is to take the first step. And yes, as cheesy as it sounded, that was my first wall, I wanted to make my personal site but there were so much options available that I didn't know where to begin. 
I had to consider the cost of the site, I wanted to **reduce cost** in every chance I got so I was pretty exited about static websites, a friend of mine recommended me to do my site this way, why?, well, I could host my static website on github for free!

Come on, it's time for you to know [Hexo](https://hexo.io/)

```javascript
npm install hexo -g
npm install hexo-cli
```

That was the easy part, the next step is to run hexo and start working!

```javascript
hexo server
```
