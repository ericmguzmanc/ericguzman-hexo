It's easy to make a decision, the dificult part is to take the first step. And yes, as cheesy as it sounded, that was my first wall, I wanted to make my personal site but there were so much options available that I didn't know where to begin. 
I had to consider the cost of the site, I wanted to reduce cost in every chance I got so I was pretty exited about static websites, a friend of mine recommended me to do my site this way, why?, well, I could host my static website on github for free!
